# 📊 Data Analytics Projects Using Python

A comprehensive data analytics project that explores various techniques for data inspection, preprocessing, transformation, visualization, and insight extraction. This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze data using Python.

---

## 🔍 Data Inspection

Performed an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics. This step involved:
- Reviewing dataset types.
- Understanding column names.
- Identifying potential data issues.

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- **Checked for missing values**: Ensured that the dataset was clean and reliable by identifying any missing data.
- **Handled null entries**: Applied strategies to fill or remove missing values.
- **Cleaned the data**: Ensured consistency and correctness in the dataset for accurate analysis.

---

## 🔄 Data Transformation

- **Encoded categorical columns**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- **Normalized numerical columns**: Scaled numerical data to a standard range, preparing it for further analysis.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

- **Detailed visualizations** were created for each column to better understand the dataset.
  - **Categorical data**: Bar plots, pie charts.
  - **Numerical data**: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

---

## 📈 Categorical Analysis

- **Bar plots and pie charts** were generated to observe the distribution of categories within categorical columns, helping to identify trends and imbalances.

---

## 📉 Numerical Analysis

- **Histograms**: Analyzed the distribution of numerical data.
- **Box plots**: Helped identify outliers and trends in numerical data.
- **Scatter plots**: Visualized the relationships between two numerical features.

---

## 💡 Insights Extraction

- Derived **meaningful insights** from the data visualization process, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.

---

## 📄 Documentation
